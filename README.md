Here, you will find [the slides](https://chrplr.github.io/tutorial-expyriment/intro-to-expyriment-slides.html) of a tutorial introduction to a Python library for cognitive experiments, [Expyriment](https:/www.expyriment.org).

The associated Python scripts are available in [`examples`](https://github.com/chrplr/tutorial-expyriment/tree/main/examples).

Rather than downloading them one by one, you can download the entire [repository](https://github.com/chrplr/tutorial-expyriment/) that contains the slides and code as a [zip file](https://github.com/chrplr/tutorial-expyriment/archive/refs/heads/main.zip), or clone it with the command:

    git clone https://github.com/chrplr/tutorial-expyriment.git


Note: [the slides](https://chrplr.github.io/tutorial-expyriment/intro-to-expyriment-slides.html) are generated from [intro-to-expyriment.md](https://github.com/chrplr/tutorial-expyriment/blob/main/intro-to-expyriment.md) by running `make`.
